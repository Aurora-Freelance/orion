**Philosopher Similarity Visualizer**

This project is a web application that visualizes the similarities between concepts as interpreted by AI. It uses a JSON file containing data about the concept, including their names, brief bios, and similarity scores, to generate an interactive visualization.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version of the project [here](https://aurora-freelance.github.io/orion/).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aurora-Freelance/orion.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Enter the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd orion
   ```

3. **Launch server\***

'''bash
python3 -m http.server & python3 -c "import webbrowser; webbrowser.open('http://localhost:8000/index.html')"
'''

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8000

4. **Explore the Visualization**: You will see bubbles representing different concepts on the screen. Each bubble contains the name and a brief bio. Click on any bubble to visualize the similarities between that concept and others. The bubbles will resize based on the similarity scores.

## Data Source

The data used in this project was generated using ChatGPT queries. Specifically, the `language.json` file contains information about each language, including the name, bio, and similarity scores. The similarity scores were determined based on the perceived similarity from the lense of ChatGPT.

## ChatGPT Queries
